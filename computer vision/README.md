# Emergency Vehicle Detection & MNIST Classification

## Overview
This project addresses two key tasks:
1. **Emergency Vehicle Detection:** A Deep learning model to detect emergency vehicles (e.g., ambulances, fire trucks) from images.
2. **MNIST Classification:** A Deep Learning classification model trained on the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0-9).
     1. Minimum number of parameters usage in the Neural Network
     2. Achieve high accuracy,Since its balanced dataset we will focus on accuracy as metrics to improve
Note :
     1.The Final Accuracy of 99.409% reached,with around 16K parameters in the model
     2.Refer pytorch for 99.36% reached with around 14k parameters in the model.
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
