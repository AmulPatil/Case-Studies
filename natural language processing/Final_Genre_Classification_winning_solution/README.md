# Movie Genre Classification

## Overview
This was Hackathon competition which implements a machine learning model to classify text data into multiple categories. The goal is to accurately predict the category or label for a given text input based on training data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF).
- **Modeling:** Includes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive_bayes, XGBoost which beat BERT models by 0.05 margin.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like mlogloss.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use of optuna to find optimal model parameters.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`,`xgboost`
