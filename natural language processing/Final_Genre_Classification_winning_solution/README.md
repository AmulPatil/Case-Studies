# Text Multiclass Classification

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify text data into multiple categories. The goal is to accurately predict the category or label for a given text input based on training data.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization, and text vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF, Word2Vec).
- **Modeling:** Includes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and deep learning models such as LSTM or BERT.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use of GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `nltk`, `tensorflow`/`pytorch` (for deep learning models)
